# Cloth development status

## Current work

As of 2026-10-29, the user selected explicit integer bindings as the first
compiler milestone after arithmetic. It is implemented and verified: `def<int>`
with mutable `=` or immutable `:=`, binding reads in expressions, and reassignment
with `=`. The user then selected type inference, now implemented and verified:
`def x = 10` and `def y := x + 2` infer from their initializers, and reassignment
must satisfy the original inferred type. Current expression types allow inferred
`int`, `float`, and `bool` bindings. Explicit `def<float>` bindings have now also been
implemented and verified, alongside `def<int>` and inferred declarations, with
the same assignment checks and mutable/immutable binding behavior.
Reusable parsing of delimited contents is an explicit implementation requirement.

Binding rules, object deletion, state dispatch, class/state
signature collisions, initial-state construction, state re-entry, absence of exit
hooks, and payload binding for running methods have been settled; see
[confirmed semantics](semantics.md).

Reusable top-level states, their host contracts, declaration and attachment
syntax, attached initial-state selection, and automatic external-transition
permission for attached public states are also confirmed in that reference.

State calls now use `object::method(...)`; ordinary instance method calls use
`object.method(...)`. `Test.co`'s attack call has been updated accordingly.

The user selected boolean bindings next. Explicit `def<bool>` and inferred
boolean bindings are implemented and verified, including `true`/`false`, reads,
copies, mutable reassignment, strict types, and immutable bindings. The user
subsequently selected one byte per boolean for now, replacing shared-byte bit
packing. LLVM expression values use `i1`; each local binding has its own `i8`
allocation. Stores zero-extend to a canonical byte value of 0 or 1; loads truncate
back to `i1`. Assignments directly store the new byte without loading its previous
contents. Fields, arrays, atomics, and foreign-interface layouts remain future work.

Prefix boolean negation is implemented and verified: `!` accepts only `bool`
operands and emits logical inversion of an `i1` value. It supports literals,
binding reads, repeated negation, parentheses, initializers, and assignments.
The user next selected `&&` and `||` with short circuiting, now implemented and
verified for `bool` operands. Precedence is `!` above `==`/`!=` above `&&` above `||`; binary
logical operators associate left to right, and parentheses override precedence.
The emitter uses conditional branches and `i1` phi values so the right operand
is evaluated only when needed. Nested expressions use their actual ending
blocks as phi predecessors. Both operands are checked before code generation.
The user next selected `==` and `!=` for booleans, then integers and floats;
all are implemented and verified. Equality returns `bool`, evaluating left then
right without short circuiting. Equality operators have equal precedence and
associate left to right. Boolean/numeric comparisons are rejected.
Integer and boolean comparisons emit `LLVMBuildICmp` with `LLVMIntEQ` or
`LLVMIntNE`. Float comparisons emit `LLVMBuildFCmp` with `LLVMRealOEQ` for `==`
and `LLVMRealUNE` for `!=`: exact value equality, signed zeros equal, and NaN
unequal to every value including itself. Infinities compare by sign and value.
Mixed `int`/`float` comparisons follow existing arithmetic promotion: convert the
integer to the current 32-bit float before comparing. Large integers can round
in that conversion (for example, `16777217 == 16777216.0` is `true` under this
policy), while `int`/`int` equality remains exact. This conversion is specific to
expressions; strict binding assignment types are unchanged.

The user then selected `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` for integers and floats, now
implemented and verified. All require two numeric operands and return `bool`;
booleans are rejected. Integer predicates are signed (`SLT`, `SGT`, `SLE`, `SGE`),
and float predicates are ordered (`OLT`, `OGT`, `OLE`, `OGE`), so every ordering
comparison with NaN is false. Signed zeros compare equal for `<=` and `>=`, and
infinities follow their numeric ordering. Mixed comparisons use the same float32
promotion described above. Arithmetic binds above ordering, ordering above
equality, equality above `&&`, and `&&` above `||`; prefix unary operators bind
above binary operators. Ordering operators associate left to right; mathematical
chains such as `1 < x < 3` are rejected because the first result is `bool`.
Use `1 < x && x < 3` for a range check.

The user then selected unsigned integer integration. `def<unsigned int>` uses
32 bits by default; explicit `int<32>`, `unsigned int<32>`, `int<64>`, and
`unsigned int<64>` bindings are implemented. Width syntax reuses the generic
delimiter parser. Unsigned types survive inferred copies, arithmetic results,
assignments, comparisons, and final output. Literals take integer context from
typed operands or binding declarations/assignments and must fit that type;
otherwise they default to signed 32-bit. Named bindings never change type to
fit a context. Signed/unsigned and different-width integer expressions require
explicit conversion, and binding assignments retain exact type checks.
Unsigned arithmetic wraps modulo the selected width, as confirmed by the user.
Unsigned division/remainder and ordering emit `udiv`/`urem` and unsigned `icmp`
predicates; float promotion uses `uitofp` for unsigned inputs. Native output uses
the appropriate signed/unsigned format, extending 8/16-bit values to 32 bits for
the native variadic calling convention. `unsigned` on another type is
rejected. `Unsigned.co` demonstrates the supported integration.

Explicit `->` casts are now implemented between all eleven numeric types: signed
and unsigned 8/16/32/64-bit integers and 16/32/64-bit floats. The user confirmed integer
wrapping/truncation, float-to-integer truncation toward zero with an error on
invalid results, and keeping booleans separate from numbers. The user also
confirmed that `1 + 2 -> float` casts the entire sum. Cast precedence sits below
arithmetic and above ordering, and chains associate left to right.
`CastExpression` retains the operator and target type. Its operand is checked
independently of the target and surrounding assignment; default integer literals
remain signed 32-bit inside casts. Larger integer literals still require an
appropriate typed binding before conversion.

`EmitCast` emits integer truncation or source-signedness-aware extension,
signed/unsigned integer-to-float conversion, and float widening/narrowing.
Float-to-integer conversions branch through ordered range checks before
`fptosi`/`fptoui`; invalid executed casts print a diagnostic with the cast's
location and exit with status 1. Checks permit fractions whose truncation fits,
including small negative fractions converting to unsigned zero. Checks occur
inside the operand's runtime path, so short circuiting skips invalid casts.
Identity casts, including `bool -> bool`, preserve the value. Boolean/numeric
casts are rejected before emission.

`ValueType` represents integer and floating families with validated width data,
plus a distinct boolean type. Numeric and boolean spellings derive from `Keywords`;
the semantic resolver uses the same keywords and supported-width sets. Explicit
widths use the required `<number>` syntax already handled by `TypeParser`.
Signed and unsigned `int<8>`, `int<16>`, `int<32>`, and `int<64>` are supported;
unannotated integers still default to signed 32-bit.

The remaining compiler type audit centralizes integer bounds, floating format
metadata, literal overflow thresholds, and display precision in `ValueType`.
Integer literal parsing derives its maximum width from the supported integer
widths, and emission passes decimal text to LLVM rather than narrowing through a
JVM `Long`. Floating literals retain decimal text, validate against the default
floating type's exact overflow threshold, and let LLVM round directly to the
semantic type. Parsing no longer fixes literals to a JVM float32 representation.
Diagnostics and emitted boolean text use `Keywords` or the resolved type spelling.

`ValueType.FloatingFormat` declares IEEE half, single, and double widths and
exponent sizes once; supported floating widths derive from those definitions.
`ValueType` also provides canonical `HALF`, `SINGLE`, and `DOUBLE` types alongside
the default `FLOAT`, and distinguishes logical `bits` from binding `storageBits`.
Booleans have one logical bit and eight storage bits; numeric storage uses the
numeric width. These language definitions do not depend on JVM type sizes.

`LLVMTypes` only maps semantic value/storage representations to LLVM constructors.
Its floating format mapping is exhaustive, so introducing a format requires an
explicit backend mapping. It defines no types, storage-width policies, C ABI
rules, or arithmetic promotion rules.

`NativeCABI` owns the current native target contract: 32-bit C int, 64-bit C long
long, double floating arguments, printing argument selection, and C conversion
specifiers. This is an explicit contract, not target ABI discovery or a derivation
from JVM or Cloth default widths. The native entry point and C library calls use
that ABI integer type regardless of Cloth's default integer width. Printing derives
its precision from shared floating metadata and reuses ordinary floating conversions.
The software half arithmetic working type is selected by `EmitHalf.arithmeticType`;
semantic expression promotion remains in `ValueType.commonFloating`.
`EmitBindings` retains the semantic type instead of reconstructing boolean storage
rules from LLVM widths. `EmitCast` uses the model's integer bounds and tests whether
the exclusive lower bound is representable instead of special-casing 64 bits.
Half conversion masks and thresholds derive from the shared floating metadata,
and binding storage follows the widths declared in `ValueType`.

`float<16>`, `float<32>`, and `float<64>` are supported in binding annotations and
cast targets. Two floats use the wider format, including half results for two
half operands. Mixing with integers uses at least float32; the presence of a
64-bit float promotes mixed numeric expressions to double. Decimal literals still start as
float32, and widening them cannot recover digits already rounded. Explicit casts
are required for float-width changes in binding assignments. All floating widths
support storage, arithmetic, negation, comparisons, and native printing.
`EmitHalf` converts IEEE binary16 values through integer bit operations, with
round-to-nearest-even for float32/64 inputs (including subnormals, signed zero,
infinities, and NaN). It converts double directly to half to avoid double rounding.
Half bindings use LLVM `half` storage; half arithmetic computes in float32 and
rounds back to half. This avoids LLVM half runtime helpers absent from the current
Windows link setup. Native printing widens half/float32 to double.
`Casts.co` demonstrates widening before arithmetic and evaluates to `4294967294`.
`Test.co` remains a broader design example: primitive `int::MAX` lookup and other
unsupported declarations in that file are not implemented by this milestone.

The milestone after numeric widths has not been chosen. Do not treat the order
of open questions or missing features as an approved plan.

## Implementation snapshot

Inspected from repository source on 2026-10-29; recheck before relying on it:

- The compiler is Kotlin/JVM in `Compiler`, built with Gradle. Its module declares
  Kotlin 2.4.20, JDK toolchain 25, and Bytedeco LLVM bindings.
- `Compiler/src/main/kotlin/cloth/Entry.kt` wires source loading, lexer, parser,
  and native LLVM compilation. It currently defaults to `Unsigned.co` and accepts
  `[source.co] [output]`, preserving source paths and using a separate output.
- `cloth/lexer/Lexer.kt`, `cloth/token/Keywords.kt`, and `Operators.kt` contain
  broader lexical machinery. Recognizing a token does not establish parser,
  type-checker, or emitter support for that language feature.
- `cloth/parser/Parser.kt` builds expression statements, explicit or inferred binding
  declarations, and simple `name = expression` assignment statements. Statements
  currently require newline separation (or EOF).
  `BindingDeclaration.type` is nullable to represent an omitted annotation.
  `cloth/parser/subs/ExpressionParser.kt` handles integer and float literals,
  boolean literals, binding names, parentheses, unary `+`/`-`/`!`, and binary `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `&&`, `||`, `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
  with precedence, plus `-> Type` casts between arithmetic and comparison
  precedence levels.
- `cloth/parser/subs/DelimitedParser.kt` provides a generic delimiter wrapper
  with caller-supplied content parsing, including angle and parenthesis helpers.
  Binding type annotations and parenthesized expressions use this wrapper;
  recursive callbacks can handle nested delimiters. `TypeParser` reads an optional
  `unsigned` modifier, a type name, and an optional nested numeric width.
  In a cast, only a complete `<number>` suffix is consumed as a width; other
  following `<` tokens remain available for ordering comparisons.
  General generic type arguments are not implemented.
- `cloth/semantic/SemanticAnalyzer.kt` checks the current single executable scope
  before LLVM emission. It rejects unknown names, duplicate declarations,
  immutable reassignment, and assignment type mismatches. An omitted annotation
  infers signed/unsigned 8/16/32/64-bit integers, 16/32/64-bit floats, or `bool` from the initializer once, preserving that type on all
  later assignments. Current assignment checks require exact types; no new
  numeric binding conversions were introduced. Integer literals can take an integer
  context without converting named bindings. A `SemanticModel` records each
  expression and statement's language type for emission, using identity keys.
  Explicit signed/unsigned 8/16/32/64-bit integers, 16/32/64-bit floats, and `bool` annotations are implemented;
  other explicit type names receive an unsupported-feature diagnostic. Casts
  resolve their target through the same type resolver as binding annotations.
  Boolean/numeric conversions and arithmetic on booleans are rejected before emission; prefix `!` requires a boolean operand and returns `bool`. `&&` and `||` require boolean operands. Equality accepts two booleans or two numbers, including mixed int/float values, and returns `bool`. Ordering comparisons require two numbers and return `bool`.
  Bindings become available after their initializer is checked;
  forward/self reads are currently rejected. This is implementation coverage,
  not a decision about declaration resolution for the broader language.
- `cloth/emitter/LLVM.kt` and `cloth/emitter/types/EmitExpression.kt` emit LLVM
  code for arithmetic, boolean negation (`LLVMBuildNot` on `i1`), short-circuit
  logical expressions (conditional branches and phi values), boolean equality and numeric equality/ordering
  comparisons (`icmp` on `i1`/`i8`/`i16`/`i32`/`i64` or `fcmp` on `float`/`double`), casts
  through `EmitCast`, and binding reads.
  Integer signedness comes from semantic types, since LLVM integer types do not
  encode it. `EmitBindings` allocates typed local
  storage and emits loads/stores (with a separate byte per boolean and conversion
  between `i1` values and `i8` storage); `EmitStatement` handles declarations and
  assignments. Native compilation prints the last statement's value and links
  a native executable. Boolean results print as `true` or `false`.
- `Math.co` is the arithmetic example; `Bindings.co` demonstrates explicit and
  inferred integer and float bindings and evaluates to `76.25`. It includes
  commented examples of invalid type-changing and immutable reassignments. `Booleans.co` demonstrates boolean inference, explicit types, copies, negation, short-circuit logic, boolean/numeric equality and inequality, numeric ordering, and reassignment, and evaluates to `true`.
  `Unsigned.co` demonstrates unsigned widths, wrapping, copies, division, float
  promotion, and comparisons, and evaluates to `true`.
  `Casts.co` demonstrates numeric conversions and evaluates to `4294967294`.
  `Test.co` describes the broader target
  language; it is not currently an end-to-end compiler test.
- Verified on 2026-10-29: `gradlew.bat :Compiler:test --offline --console=plain`
  passed all 75 tests across `BindingsTest.kt`, `UnsignedIntegersTest.kt`,
  `CastsTest.kt`, and `NumericWidthsTest.kt`.
  Tests cover syntax, nested delimiter callbacks, semantic diagnostics, native
  arithmetic/assignment/copy behavior, inferred integer and float bindings,
  explicit floats with strict type and immutability checks, fixed inferred types
  on reassignment, mixed arithmetic, and CLI source/output paths. CLI tests
  compile and run all five examples (`76.25`, `6689`, `true`, `true`, and
  `4294967294`). New boolean
  checks cover syntax, strict types, arithmetic rejection, immutable bindings,
  separate byte allocations at 1/2/8/9/16/17 boolean bindings with interleaved
  integers and floats, native independent reassignment and copied values, and
  literal/assignment output. Negation checks cover prefix parsing, malformed
  operands, bool-only typing, nested negation, native literal and binding
  inversion, assignment, snapshots, and lexer separation of negation, equality, inequality, and assignment.
  Logical-operator tests cover malformed syntax, precedence and associativity,
  strict operand types (including skipped operands), generated branches that
  bypass the right operand's load, native truth tables using bindings, nested
  left/right logical expressions, negation, assignments, snapshots, and later
  numeric statements. Equality tests cover syntax, precedence, left associativity,
  boolean/numeric mixing rejection, fixed binding types, immutability, native truth
  tables for literals and bindings, negation, snapshots, assignments, and nested
  short-circuit expressions on either side of comparisons. Numeric equality
  tests cover exact integer values and boundaries, float values, signed zeros,
  infinities, NaN on either side, mixed promotion in both directions (including
  float32 rounding), arithmetic precedence, bool result storage and immutability,
  and short-circuit guards that skip integer division by zero. Ordering tests
  cover each operator for less/equal/greater cases, signed integer boundaries,
  float and mixed values, signed zeros, infinities, NaN on either side, float32
  rounding, precedence, malformed syntax, bool result storage and immutability,
  rejected bool operands and comparison chains, and guarded division by zero.
  Unsigned tests cover modifier and nested-width parsing, literal range checks,
  signedness and width preservation through inference/copy/reassignment, rejected
  implicit conversions, invalid modifiers, immutable bindings, unsigned LLVM
  instructions, native 32/64-bit boundary output, wrapping arithmetic, exact
  unsigned division/remainder/ordering/equality, positive unsigned float promotion
  and float32 rounding, short-circuit guards, independent storage alongside all
  existing primitive types, and signed 64-bit arithmetic/printing regressions.
  Cast tests cover syntax, agreed precedence and associativity, width/comparison
  disambiguation, exact binding rules, all 121 numeric source/target pairs, integer
  wrapping and source-signedness-aware widening, float32/64 precision and mixed
  promotion, float-to-integer boundary fractions and rounding, controlled errors
  for out-of-range values/NaN/infinities, bool separation and identity casts,
  runtime guards inside nested short circuits, copies, and generated conversion
  instructions and error paths. Float64 tests also cover arithmetic, negation,
  remainder, comparison, infinities, NaN, signed zero, storage, and printing.
  Numeric-width tests cover signed/unsigned 8/16-bit literal bounds, wrapping,
  storage, copies, printing, signed/unsigned arithmetic and comparisons, explicit
  conversions, strict binding types, keyword-derived spelling, width validation,
  half arithmetic and mixed promotion, and small float-to-integer range guards.
  Half conversion checks compare native results against JDK IEEE binary16
  conversions around normal/subnormal, tie, signed-zero, and overflow boundaries;
  double-to-half tests check direct rounding at ties and the overflow threshold.
  Default floating literal tests also cover exact decimal midpoint rounding,
  values immediately around overflow, and preservation of rounded values through
  inferred copies and native comparisons.
  The test directory is now
  exempted from the broad test-directory ignore rule so tests can be tracked.
  `gradlew.bat :Compiler:run --args="Bindings.co" --offline --console=plain`
  also succeeded; running `Bindings.exe` printed `76.25`.

Repository-relative paths above identify current implementation locations; they
are not language specification boundaries.

## Open design questions

The following have not yet been settled. Ask about them when relevant, keeping
the user's preference for one question at a time:

- Type-narrowing behavior after reassignment and outside successful `if` branches.
- Default equality semantics for class instances: identity or field values.
- Whether there are restrictions on individual source-to-target transition paths.
  The confirmed phrase "permitted states" means class-supported states, not an
  approved transition-graph restriction mechanism.
- Whether state payloads can escape through stored or returned bindings, and
  their lifetime after the originating method finishes.
- The exact diagnostics/error model for invalid-state calls and deleted-object access.
- Deleting an already-invalid binding or intentionally null value.
- The next compiler milestone and its acceptance criteria after numeric widths.

This list is a set of unresolved areas, not an exhaustive specification checklist
or a set of required features.
