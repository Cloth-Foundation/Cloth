Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Loom**, a statically typed systems language with value semantics, forward declarations, and a modern standard library. Whether you're fixing a typo, proposing a new language feature, or optimizing the compiler, your contribution matters!

---

## Repository Overview

Loom consists of two major components:

- `loom-compiler/`: The Loom compiler, written in **OCaml**
- `std/`: The standard library, written in **Loom**
- `loomc-java`: The old implementation of the Loom Compiler, written in **Java**.

---

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **OCaml (5.x+)** ‚Äî [Install with opam](https://ocaml.org/docs/up-and-running)
- **Dune (>= 3.x)** ‚Äî OCaml build system
- `git`, `make`, and a Unix-like environment

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SuperScary/Loom.git
cd loom
````

### Build the Compiler

```bash
make
```

This will compile the OCaml source code in the `loom-compiler/` directory and place the `loomc` binary in `build/`.

### Run the Test Suite

```bash
make test
```

---

## Working on the Standard Library

The standard library is written in Loom itself and located in the `std/` directory. After modifying any `.lm` files:

```bash
make std
```

This will rebuild the library and run syntax validation. Contributions to the standard library **must** adhere to Loom style conventions (see below).

---

## Testing Your Changes

You can test `.lm` code manually:

```bash
./build/loomc examples/hello.lm
```

Or add automated tests in:

```
tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ language/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ typecheck/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stdlib/
```

Use `.lm` source files and include expected output/diagnostics.

## üìù Contribution Guidelines

### 1. File Structure

* Place new compiler modules in `loom-compiler/`.
* Place new standard modules in `std/`.
* Add examples to `examples/` if demonstrating features.

### 2. Commit Messages

Use clear and descriptive commit messages:

```
parser: add support for ternary expressions
std: fix bug in strings.toLowerCase
```

### 3. Style Guide

#### OCaml (Compiler)

* 2-space indentation
* Descriptive `let` bindings
* Use modules to separate concerns (`Lexer`, `Parser`, `Typechecker`, etc.)

#### Loom (Stdlib)

* Use `camelCase` for functions and variables
* Avoid unnecessary `null`
* Prefer expressions over imperative code where possible
* All functions should be documented with comments

---

## Feature Proposals (RFCs)

All language-level or compiler-impacting changes must go through the **RFC process**.

1. Fork the repo and create a branch like `rfc/feature-name`
2. Add your proposal to `rfcs/` using the template
3. Submit a pull request and tag it `[RFC]`

See `docs/RFC_PROCESS.md` for full details.
