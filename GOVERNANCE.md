## Overview

The Cloth programming language is developed and maintained under the stewardship of the **Cloth Foundation**, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the advancement of reliable, expressive, and modern programming tools. Cloth's governance model is designed to encourage collaboration, transparency, and long-term stability.

---

## 1. Ownership

The Cloth language and all official tools, documentation, and standards are owned by the **Cloth Foundation**. The foundation is the ultimate legal entity responsible for:

- Intellectual property and trademarks
- Fiscal management (donations, sponsorships)
- Licensing and contributor agreements
- Appointment and oversight of the Steering Council

---

## 2. Governance Structure

The Cloth Project is governed by a **Steering Council** composed of experienced contributors and maintainers. This council is entrusted with technical decision-making and high-level direction of the language.

### 2.1 Steering Council Responsibilities

- Approve or reject language RFCs and major proposals
- Establish and evolve the project's technical roadmap
- Appoint or remove core maintainers and leads
- Mediate disputes and resolve community escalations
- Represent Cloth in partnerships, conferences, and outreach

### 2.2 Council Composition

- The Steering Council consists of **5 to 7 members**.
- Council members serve **indefinite terms** but may step down at any time.
- New members are nominated and elected by existing council members, based on merit and long-term involvement.

### 2.3 Decision Making

- Technical decisions require **majority approval**.
- In case of ties or inactivity, the Council Chair may cast a deciding vote.
- All decisions must be **documented and public**, with rationale when appropriate.

---

## 3. Core Contributors

Core contributors are trusted developers with write access to the Cloth repository. They are responsible for:

- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Triaging bugs and feature requests
- Maintaining documentation and tools
- Participating in RFC discussions

### 3.1 Becoming a Core Contributor

Core contributors are nominated by existing members or the Council and must:

- Demonstrate consistent, high-quality contributions
- Adhere to the Code of Conduct and community norms
- Show willingness to mentor and collaborate

---

## 4. Community Roles

### 4.1 Maintainers

Maintain specialized components (e.g. lexer, parser, standard library). They have merge rights over their domain but are expected to coordinate with other maintainers and follow the technical roadmap.

### 4.2 Proposal Authors

Anyone can submit language enhancements via the **Cloth RFC process**. Authors shepherd their proposals from drafting to approval.

---

## 5. RFC Process

Major language changes (syntax, semantics, compiler structure) must go through a Request for Comments (RFC) process. The RFC process is intended to:

- Encourage community input
- Ensure thorough technical discussion
- Document design rationale and tradeoffs

More information is available in `docs/RFC_PROCESS.md`.

---

## 6. Transparency & Accountability

- All decisions by the Steering Council are published publicly in the Cloth GitHub discussions or dev blog.
- Regular **quarterly updates** summarize progress and direction.
- Cloth adheres to a **meritocratic and respectful culture** of open development.

---

## 7. Amendments

This document may be amended by the Steering Council via majority vote. Proposed changes must be reviewed by the community and posted publicly for feedback for a minimum of 7 days prior to ratification.
