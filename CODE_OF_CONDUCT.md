## Purpose

The Cloth Foundation is dedicated to building a powerful, elegant, and safe programming language. This Code of Conduct outlines expectations for behavior to ensure a respectful, inclusive, and productive environment for everyone involved—contributors, maintainers, and community members.

## Guiding Principles

- **Clarity & Collaboration**: We work together to design clear, maintainable systems. We favor discussion over assumption, and consensus over command.
- **Respect & Inclusion**: All contributions are welcome, regardless of experience, identity, or background. Everyone’s voice matters.
- **Transparency**: Decisions about the language are made openly and documented thoroughly. We value thoughtful rationale and open discourse.
- **Humility & Growth**: We recognize we’re all learners. We approach disagreements with curiosity and assume good intent.

---

## Expected Behavior

We expect all team members and contributors to:

- Be **respectful** and **courteous** to others.
- Provide **constructive feedback** rooted in technical merit.
- Use **inclusive language** and avoid personal attacks or demeaning comments.
- **Listen** actively, especially during disagreements.
- Respect boundaries around **mental load, time, and availability**.
- Be receptive to **editorial, design, and architectural critique**.

---

## Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of behavior that will not be tolerated:

- Harassment, bullying, or threats (online or in person).
- Discriminatory language or exclusionary jokes.
- Persistent interruptions or talking over others.
- Dismissing contributors due to inexperience or background.
- Deliberately undermining team decisions or sabotaging progress.

---

## Decision Making

- Major changes to Cloth (grammar, semantics, features) require consensus or majority agreement in team discussions.
- Experimental proposals should go through an **RFC process**.
- In case of stalemates, a designated **Lead Maintainer** may step in as tie-breaker.

---

## Reporting & Enforcement

If you witness or experience any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:

1. Please reach out to a Cloth Team or Cloth Foundation in private.
2. Reports will be handled **confidentially** and **respectfully**.
3. Violators may receive a warning, temporary ban, or permanent removal depending on severity.

---

## Final Notes

We are building something ambitious. The language is only as strong as the team behind it. Let’s work together in good faith to make Cloth a language we’re proud of—and a team others aspire to join.

The Cloth Foundation
